# Superstore-Sales-Anaylsis-Using-Excel
For this project I examined sales data from a retail superstore using Excel to identify important trends and patterns. I evaluated inventory management sales performance profitability and forecasts to inform strategic planning using in-depth financial analysis. The project resulted in comprehensive reports with suggestions and insights that could be put into practice to enhance business operations and drive growth.
